# hello-goit
My first repository. I am learning how to create it and trying to figure out how it works.
Hi mentor, 
I am doing my home assignments given by GoIt now and do my best to understand what I am doing. It is a bit difficult, but I won't give up.
Please, if you chacked my homeworks that have been already done, write me your remarks and seggestions. I will try to prove my mistakes, redo them and be a good student.
Best wishes,
Yusupov Mamurbek
